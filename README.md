## planned projects:
1. convert commands to dashfoo (kingbowser command system from like 8 years ago that is still unmatched)
2. fix panel scrolling in click-gui from allowing overscroll / messing up width.
3. baritone support?
4. better way of entry into the game than a core mod, IE: through the meta-inf like in 1.16.
