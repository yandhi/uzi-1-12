## planned projects:

1. convert commands to dashfoo (kingbowser command system from like 8 years ago that is still unmatched)
2. fix panel scrolling in click-gui from allowing overscroll / messing up width.
3. baritone support?
4. better way of entry into the game than a core mod, IE: through the meta-inf like in 1.16.
5. overlay converted to a proper component system (maybe using sodapop?)
6. media now playing for hud.
